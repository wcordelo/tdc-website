                                Lady McCormick was a U.S. biologist, suffragist, and philanthropist. Graduating from
                                MIT in 1904, she would donate the money to found Stanley McCormick Hall, an all
                                female dormitory; her goal was to provide female students a permanent place at MIT;
                                she had one request: to see the construction of the building in her life-time.

                                Chi the land title to the Dean's Mansion on 372, in exchange for the title to our
                                mansion on 314 (present day McCormick West Wing). In 1966 the first Theta Delta Chi
                                pledge class was initiated in the Theta Deuteron Mansion. The McCormick towers opened
                                in 1963 (west tower) and 1967 (east tower). Lady McCormick passed two years later,

                    undergraduate Brother and a former Rush Girl of TDC, we have unique insights into our
                    house unlike many other GRAs because we were, and still are, part of this family.
                    Brothers and friends of TDC use us as a resource for navigating MIT, getting fed, and a

                    Theta Delta Chi boasts a tight-knit group of 30+ active brothers from a variety of different
                    backgrounds. Brothers have attended public, private, and boarding schools as well as being
                    home-schooled. They hail from all areas of the United States as well as internationally from Latin
                    America, the Caribbean, and Europe. Their broad backgrounds are exemplified by the fact that
                    brothers major in almost every engineering major at MIT as well as non-engineering majors and/or
                    minors in fields such as music, biology, management, economics, and brain and cognitive sciences.

                    Brother involvement extends throughout the MIT campus. Current brothers are on the executive boards
                    of DanceTroupe, Live Music Connection, Dramashop, Colleges Against Cancer, the Society of Hispanic
                    Professional Engineers, and the Interfraternity Council. Brother involvement on campus extends into

                    exploring the world. Many alumni create start-ups with other Theta Delta Chi brothers and provide

                    events in all forms for brothers, friends, and the Boston-Cambridge community at large to de-stress
                    and have fun. Events range from large parties in our pub with a DJ Booth and custom light shows to
                    mixers with MIT sororities to small themed parties for close and future friends of the house. Dance
                    classes are notorious for attracting large audiences to let out their inner swag with some hip hop or
                    to explore new areas of dance and culture with salsa dancing.

                    More private social events include an annual hiking trip, beach trips, and weekend retreats. During

                    Additionally, Theta Delta Chi hosts a formal each semester. The Fall Formal, called Alumni Banquet,
                    is attended by hundreds of alumni, active brothers, and dates alike. Alumni are invited to a
                    celebratory dinner in Boston, where the achievements of alumni and actives are recognized and MIT
                    faculty and staff are thanked for the support they show during the school year. Spring Banquet is
                    hosted the next semester to celebrate the achievements of the year, to thank friends of the
                    fraternity for their support, and to say goodbye to the seniors who always leave Theta Delta Chi
                    better than they found it.

                    continuing struggle and chef January Lanosa's son going through cancer treatments. The Brothers felt
                    it was a great way to give back to the relatives and friends who have struggled with or passed away

                    Theta Delta Chi participated in MIT's first Relay for Life in 2011, in which they raised $6646, the
                    second highest of any organization out of the 38 participating. Relay for Life is an all-night event
                    in which participating teams have at least one person walking around the track at all times. The
                    event took place at MIT where hundreds of people came together to raise cancer awareness and
                    contribute to the stated goal of creating more birthdays. One sixth of the funds contributed by
                    Theta Delta Chi were raised through the social philanthropy event TDCares. About a third of the funds
                    were contributed by alumni, and the remainder was contributed by personal and professional relations

                    Camp Kesem is a nationwide community, driven by passionate college student leaders, that supports
                    children through and beyond their parentâ€™s cancer. A program of Kesem, Camp Kesem operates over 70
                    free summer camps in 34 states for children ages 6 to 16 who have been touched by a parentâ€™s cancer.
                    This camping experience has a lasting impact on children by providing them a peer-support network
                    that understands their unique needs, builds confidence and strengthens their communication skills.
                    In 2015, Camp Kesem served over 5,000 children coast-to-coast - all funded by generous donations
                    from individuals and corporate support.
