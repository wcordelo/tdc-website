          Theta Delta Chi is an international organizations with the belief that it is every member’s duty to improve themselves intellectually, morally, and socially. This is not only limited to one’s own growth, but the growth of one’s brothers as well. Here at the Theta Deuteron Chapter, these aren’t just words we say we live by, these are words we put into practice.

          While MIT is a wonderful institution of higher learning, it is by no means a walk in the park. Very few can do it all on their own. From the enjoyable times to the toughest times, our brothers are always there for each other regardless of the circumstance. Our brothers will strive to bring out the best in each other and push even further. We don’t conform to sharing a single identity and instead embrace our diversity, whether it’d be in our hobbies, interests, culture, religion, home, socio-economic status, and even our aspirations. And it's through these differences that we are able to provide a more holistic experience for each other by being able to share our different experiences with each other. Even if it leads to challenging each other’s viewpoints, as Theta Delta Chi members and as MIT students we believe that is is only through having diverse mindsets clash that we can reach our zenith and it's why our brothers are able to develop into such amazing individuals.

          I have had the fortune of finding a wonderful, albeit silly at times, group of brothers who genuinely support each other in the crazy roller coaster that is MIT undergrad. If it weren’t for the lovingly quirky family I have found here, I would not be nowhere near the person I am today. There is so much I have learned from my brothers, and so much more I have yet to learn. I encourage you to get to meet our brothers and become a part of our family if possible.
